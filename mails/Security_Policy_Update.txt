Subject: Urgent: Security Policy Update

Dear John,

We are currently in the process of updating our company-wide security protocols to better protect our systems and data.
All employees are required to reset their passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on their accounts by the end of this week.

To complete these actions, please log in to the IT portal and follow the instructions under the "Security Update" section.
These measures are crucial in light of recent cyber incidents affecting organizations similar to ours.

If you encounter any issues with the new process or have questions about 2FA, please get in touch with the IT support team for assistance.
Your cooperation is vital to ensuring the continued security of our organization.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Joseph
IT Department
