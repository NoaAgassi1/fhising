Subject: Monthly Report Submission

Hi John,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach the end of the month,
I wanted to remind you to submit your monthly performance report by this Friday.
The report should include a summary of your completed tasks, ongoing projects, and any challenges you faced during the month.

Please upload your report to the internal portal under the "Monthly Reports" section.
If you need any clarification on the required format or content,
feel free to refer to the template provided in last month's email or contact me directly.

Timely submission of the report is essential for our departmental review and planning.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best,
Joseph
Team Lead
