Subject: Salary Update Notification

Dear John,

I wanted to inform you that the annual salary review process is scheduled to take place next week.
In preparation for this, the HR department is requesting that all employees verify their personal
and banking information on the HR portal to ensure that there are no issues with the upcoming payroll adjustments.

It is important that your records are up to date so that there will be no delays or errors in processing your new salary details.
If you have recently changed your address, phone number, or bank account, please update this information at your earliest convenience.

If you have any questions regarding the process or encounter any difficulties accessing the portal,
 do not hesitate to reach out to me or the HR team for assistance.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Joseph
HR Manager
