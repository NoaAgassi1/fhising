Subject: Meeting Rescheduled

Hi John,

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to let you know that our previously scheduled team meeting has been moved to Thursday at 2:00 PM due to a scheduling conflict.
The agenda will include project updates, discussion of upcoming deadlines, and a review of action items from last week.

Please update your calendar accordingly and let me know if you have any topics you would like to add to the agenda.
If you are unable to attend, please inform me in advance and provide your updates in writing so we can keep the team aligned.

Looking forward to seeing everyone at the meeting.

Best regards,
Joseph
Project Manager
